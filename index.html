            <p>Once there was a strange time where a <span class="word">${word01}</span> took over the world
             and made us all stay span <span class="word">${word02}</span> at home.  So we 
             <span class="word">${word03}</span> into our imagination and found out the key to 
             <span class="word">${word04}</span> was all about wearing <span class="word">${word05}</span> 
             with <span class="word">${word06}</span>.  It turned out that this was also the trick to turning 
             on our <span class="word">${word07}</span> and getting to do everything you love all at once.  
             Now, we can eat <span class="word">${word08}</span> while playing <span class="word">${word09}</span>, 
             or search for <span class="word">${word10}</span> while singing <span class="word">${word11}</span>.  
             One time, we even turned <span class="word">${word12}</span> into a <span class="word">${word13}</span>.  
             Don’t believe us?  Just say <span class="word">" ${word14} "</span> and we’ll show you.</p>
